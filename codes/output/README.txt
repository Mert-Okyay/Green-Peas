naming for CCF(ccf between peas, pearandoms, lrgs, lrg randoms) results: 
rp: bins used for peas. same across pimax variations.
wp: 2 point correlatiopn function. 
_err: errors for a given calculation
jack: jackknife resampling
pixx: wp calc for for pimax = xx
cov: covariance matrix?

there are lrg jackknifes as well. 

used  m = 5 for jackknife. 25 patches(i bleive 10/24)

naming for CCF plots:

peas lrg ccf_wP versus Pimax fixed rP_xx
should be obvious from the abbreviations above.
